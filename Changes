Revision history for CGI::Fast

2.05 2014-12-11
    [TESTING]
    remove useless use of Test::Deep in tests

    this patch was sourced from the fedora perl-devel mailing list[1],
    in which i see more patches for CGI - fedora perl-devel people: if
    you're going to patch modules then please send those patches upstream
    where relevant. many perl modules are now on github (including this
    one) so it's easy, and it prevents alternate versions of modules
    that could lead to frustrating debugging sessions because *your*
    version of FCGI (2.04) is different to what the *real* version of
    FCGI (2.04) is[2].

     * [1] https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/perl-devel
     * [2] the "real" version of FCGI being that available on CPAN

    [TESTING]
    - Fix tests for recent version of CGI (v4.05+), which removed the
      -private_tempfiles pragma and PRIVATE_TEMPFILES variable, so use
      on that is still available for testing

    - allow FCGI_SOCKET_PATH and FCGI_LISTEN_QUEUE ENV variables to be
      passed in as import settings, although favour ENV variables if set
    - delay creation of FCGI::Request until the first call to CGI::Fast->new
      (RT #70609), removing the need to defined these in a BEGIN block
    - add test to check ENV values are not recycled from old requests and not
      set as defaults when the FCGI_SOCKET_PATH is used (RT #65492)
    - add file_handles method to allow setting of file handles to be passed
      to FCGI (RT #94423)
