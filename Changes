Version 2.02 Jun 05, 2014

    [INTERNALS]
    - allow FCGI_SOCKET_PATH and FCGI_LISTEN_QUEUE ENV variables to be
      passed in as import settings, although favour ENV variables if set
    - delay creation of FCGI::Request until the first call to CGI::Fast->new
      (RT #70609), removing the need to defined these in a BEGIN block
    - add test to check ENV values are not recycled from old requests and not
      set as defaults when the FCGI_SOCKET_PATH is used (RT #65492)
    - add file_handles method to allow setting of file handles to be passed
      to FCGI (RT #94423)
